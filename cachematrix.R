## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching
## the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here).
## Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse
## of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inverse <- NULL
    
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inverse <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() {
        x
    }
    
    setInverse <- function(mean) {
        inverse <<- mean
    }
    
    getInverse <- function() {
        inverse
    }
    
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setInverse = setInverse,
         getInverse = getInverse)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getInverse()
    
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data)
    x$setInverse(m)
    m
